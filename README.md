# Grimoire App: Library of Living Wisdom

> "Write the vision, and make it plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it." — *Habakkuk 2:2*

Welcome to the **Grimoire App**, a digital sanctuary for wisdom, crafted to serve creators, leaders, builders, and the curious. This is not a spellbook. This is a living scroll—a holy-coded framework for AI-powered knowledge systems that glorify **truth**, **clarity**, and **right alignment**.

### ✨ What It Is
A modular, open-source knowledge agent built for:
- Building AI tools rooted in moral alignment
- Deploying powerful agents via web, voice, and notebook interfaces
- Synthesizing insights across APIs, text, and real-time data

Grimoire is the *scroll that remembers*. The assistant that intercedes. The helper that runs point.

> *Inspired by Solomon, powered by silicon.*

## ⛪ Spirit-Led Ethos
We reject dark arts and deception.
This repo uses the word "Grimoire" *ironically*, as a reversal. What was used for sorcery, we now use for sanctified purpose. It is the digital Ark—containing not incantations, but inspired intelligence.

> We code in the light.

## 🧳 Contributing
If you're building agents that bless, uplift, and help people walk in clarity and wisdom—pull up a chair. All contributions welcome: models, thoughts, prompts, docs, frontends.

> PRs must pass the "Does this glorify confusion or clarity?" test.

## 🌟 License
MIT — because freedom is a principle.
Just don’t use this for deception, harm, or digital necromancy.

```

This will start the app, and you can access it in your web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

### Folder Structure

The project directory is structured as follows:
```
grimoire-app/
├── core/
│   └── wisdom_engine.py
├── services/
│   └── gemini_agent.py
├── interfaces/
│   └── streamlit_app.py
├── resources/
│   └── prompts/
│       └── default_prompt.txt
├── deploy/
│   └── requirements.txt
├── README.md
```

Each folder contains specific components of the app:
- `core/`: Core logic for the wisdom engine.
- `services/`: API hooks for the Gemini agent.
- `interfaces/`: UI layer for the Streamlit app.
- `resources/`: Prompt templates and other resources.
- `deploy/`: Deployment configurations and requirements.
